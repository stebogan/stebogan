Hi! My name is Stephen Bogan.
I'm interested in turbulent, hypersonic airflow and modeling nonlinear phenomena.
I am currently studying Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Syracuse University. I have an undergraduate background in Physics and Applied Math.
Take a look at some of my past projects (personal and school related) as well as my current projects.
